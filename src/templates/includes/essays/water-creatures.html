    On Sunday, August 4, 2019, we launched a thirty-foot water creature on Bayou St. John. Over the course of the preceding week, artist Carole Alden led the design and creation of this sculpture, working primarily with salvaged materials provided by the Green Project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Artist Carole Alden learned about the Blue House and Civic Studio through Mixed Media I: Incarceration, while she was in prison. After completing her sentence in 2019, she joined us in New Orleans to imagine, build, and launch a large water creature inspired by the waterways and water systems of New Orleans.

    Carole developed a floating frame for the fish using sawn PVC pipe sections, metal wiring, and insulation foam. Carole guided volunteers in turning construction fencing and old CDs into a glittering skin for the fish, reworking discarded grass mats into fins, and laser discs into eyes and teeth. She also installed solar-powered lights to light up the fish at night.
  </p>
  <p>
    The creature lived out on Bayou St. John for two days and two nights, and has been re-installed at the Green Project for public viewing.

    During the course of construction, Carole made only one drawing. She relied, instead, on an intuitive feel for scale, structure, texture, and materials. She developed construction details that made it possible for people of all ages and abilities to take part in the making of the fish, from the way in which the fish skin was painted and textured, to the way in which recycled plastic threads were used to connect different pieces.
