  <p>
    Who are the people that run New Orleans’ drainage pump stations, 24 hours a day? We spoke with operators at five different stations and got to know them as individuals. Proud parents and trumpet players, power lifters and auto mechanics, philosophers and rideshare drivers -- they are each striving to make a living and to support their families. As Utility Plant Worker Rob Barrow puts it, working at the Sewerage and Water Board is also “a chance to help the city.” 
  </p>
  <p>
    A few common threads emerged in our conversations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first is that the SWBNO provides relatively good employment conditions in a city where so many residents only have access to low-paying service and tourism jobs. Relief Operator Larry Boudreaux describes the importance of the SWBNO to the city’s underserved populations: someone without a high school degree, or with a prior felony conviction, is able to provide for their family if they complete the SWBNO’s training program and dedicate themself to the work. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The second is that the operators see themselves as emergency personnel, their work vital to the safety of their fellow New Orleanians. Of the many sacrifices that operators make, the most significant is that each is asked to leave their families to report to work when tropical storms bear down on the region. As Utility Plant Worker Louis Johnston says, “Family have to be responsible over there, when I have to be here.”

    <figcaption>Drainage and Sewerage Superintendent Gerald Tilton left college at 24 to join the SWBNO. He had planned to stay at the SWBNO for a short time before returning to school, but came to appreciate the significance of what he was doing and never left. Looking at logs from early in the 20th century, Gerald often reflects on the fact that others have stood where he stands, completing similar tasks for over a century.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>Conard “CJ” James <span class="image-orientation-direction-desktop">(left)</span><span class="image-orientation-direction-mobile">(top)</span> is a supervisor, and a 38-year veteran of the SWBNO. CJ’s clothes are always impeccably pressed. He came out of retirement a few years back to facilitate staff training. Kenneth McGuire Sr. <span class="image-orientation-direction-desktop">(right)</span><span class="image-orientation-direction-mobile">(bottom)</span> is one of the supervisor assistants.</figcaption>

This means both men have the knowledge and skills to operate multiple pump stations, each with its own particularities and eras of machinery. Lionel left a job as a sales manager in telecommunications to join the SWBNO six years ago, while Larry has worked 31 years on the job. He loves the responsibility of training younger staff, making sure they understand the ins and outs of the machinery they operate.</figcaption>

Both have been with the SWBNO for over twenty years. These operators are at the controls in each of the city’s pump stations, making decisions about which pumps to turn on and off, and communicating with other pump stations and “Central” so that their station is working in concert with the other parts of the drainage network.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>Louis Johnston <span class="image-orientation-direction-desktop">(left)</span><span class="image-orientation-direction-mobile">(top)</span> works with Dominique Coleman at DPS 19 as a utility plant worker, known also as a “UPW” or a “helper.” Like many other pump station operators, both Louis and Dominique work additional jobs in order to support their families. Jonathan Foster <span class="image-orientation-direction-desktop">(right)</span><span class="image-orientation-direction-mobile">(bottom)</span> is a UPW at DPS 1, and a trumpet player. Both are nearing the end of the seven phase training program that UPWs undergo to become pump station operators. Jonathan sees his work at the SWBNO as a way to pave the way for his child to work a city job in the future.</figcaption>

Like Rob, D’juan is coming up on three years at the SWBNO. Both are itching to become pump station operators as they near the last phase of training. Rob’s goal is to do his job “to perfection” once he makes operator, and to become a leader amongst his peers, showing them what’s possible in a city where he sees many young people doing things because of peer pressure, for lack of economic opportunities, and often with their “backs against the wall.” </figcaption>
