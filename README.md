Mixed Media is a platform for collective learning and civic dialogue around critical issues that affect New Orleans.

Issue 2 is Mixed Media's 2nd publication, and it is about Water Systems. Below is a quote from the site.

> Mixed Media: Water Systems brought together artists, researchers, planners, scientists, journalists, facilitators, curators, Sewerage & Water Board staff, and resident leaders to produce civically-oriented artwork, media content, and public events.
